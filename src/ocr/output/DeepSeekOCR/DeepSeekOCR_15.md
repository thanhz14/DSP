##### 4.3.2. Multilingual recognition

PDF data on the Internet contains not only Chinese and English, but also a large amount of multilingual data, which is also crucial when training LLMs. For PDF documents, DeepSeek-OCR can handle nearly 100 languages. Like Chinese and English documents, multilingual data also supports both layout and non-layout OCR formats. The visualization results are shown in Figure 11, where we select Arabic and Sinhala languages to demonstrate results.
