In general, the extent of chemical reaction was small, and changes in gas properties were brought about largely by the gas dynamics associated with boundary layer growth.",

Hydrogen, oxygen, and argon were high purity tank gases and were used without further purification. Carbon monoxide was condensed at liquid nitrogen temperature; about one-quarter of the condensate was pumped off and discarded. Dry ice served as a convenient source of carbon dioxide. It was purified by sub-liming three-quarters of a sample into a liquid nitrogen cooled trap. The first quarter of this trapped fraction was discarded and the middle half used for mixture preparation.",

Conditions behind the shocks, in the region of the experimental measurements, were obtained from a computer program which integrated the equations of chemical change for a shocked gas accounting for the effects of boundary layer buildup. In general, the extent of chemical reaction was small, and changes in gas properties were brought about largely by the gas dynamics associated with boundary layer growth.",
