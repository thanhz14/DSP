and the rule is proved that

 $$ \frac{d u^{s}}{d z}=n u^{s-1}\frac{d u}{d z}, $$ 

where n is a positive fraction whose numerator and denominator are integers. This rule has already been used in the solution of numerous exercises.

34. The Derivative of a Constant. Let $y = c$, where $c$ is a constant. Corresponding to any $\Delta x$, $\Delta y = 0$, and consequently

 $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=0, $$ 

and

 $$ \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=0, $$ 

or

 $$ \frac{d y}{d z}=0. $$ 

The derivative of a constant is zero.

35. The Derivative of the Sum of Two Functions. Let

 $$ y=u+v, $$ 

where u and v are functions of x. Let Δu, Δv, and Δy be the increments of u, v, and y, respectively, corresponding to the increment Δx.

 $$ y+\Delta y=u+\Delta u+v+\Delta v $$ 

 $$ \Delta y=\Delta u+\Delta v $$ 

 $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta z}+\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} $$ 

 $$ \frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}+\frac{e}{f} $$ 

 $$ \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dx}, $$ 

or

 $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v})}{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{u}}{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{x}}+\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{v}}{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{x}}. $$ 

The derivative of the sum of two functions is equal to the sum of their derivatives.

## 34 The Derivative of a Constant

where n is a positive fraction whose numerator and denominator are integers. This rule has already been used in the solution of numerous exercises.

Let y = c, where c is a constant. Corresponding to any Dz, Dy = 0, and consequently

 $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=0, $$ 

 $$ \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=0, $$ 

35 The Derivative of the Sum of Two Functions

 $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=0. $$ 

The derivative of a constant is zero. Interpret this result geometrically.

 $$ \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{d x}{d x}+\frac{d v}{d x}, $$ 

 $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta x}+\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} $$ 

where u and v are functions of x. Let  $ D_u $,  $ D_v $, and  $ D_y $ be the increments of u, v, and y, respectively, corresponding to the increment  $ D_x $.

 $$ \Delta g=\Delta w+\Delta v $$ 

 $$ \frac{d(u+v)}{dx}=\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dx}. $$ 

 $ y + \Delta y = u + \Delta u + v + \Delta v $

The derivative of the sum of two functions is equal to the sum of their derivatives.

 $$ P=2k\int_{0}^{6}y x d y. $$ 

z is expressed in terms of y by means of the equation of the ellipse.

Then

 $$ \frac{x^{2}}{64}+\frac{y^{2}}{36}=1. $$
