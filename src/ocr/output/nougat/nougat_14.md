Here  $ \nu_1 = k_1[H_2] $,  $ \nu_2 = k_2[O_2] $,  $ \nu_3 = k_3[H_2] $,  $ \nu_4 = k_4[O_2][M] $, and  $ \nu_5 = k_5[CO] $. Thus the exponential growth constant  $ \lambda $ depends on the gas composition and the rate constants of reactions I to V. This paper reports measurements on mixtures chosen to permit determinations of the rates of reactions I, II, III, and V. Mixtures were selected by analyzing equation (1).

## EXPERIMENTAL ASPECTS

Growth constants were obtained by measuring the blue carbon monoxide flame band emission behind incident shocks. The intensity of this radiation is proportional to the product of carbon monoxide and oxygen atom concentrations (ref. 3), and since very little carbon monoxide is consumed, the light monitors the increase of oxygen atom concentration with time.

Gas mixtures contained varying amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, oxygen and in some mixtures carbon dioxide, dilated five to tenfold with argon. Hydrogen, oxygen, and argon were high purity tank gases and were used without further purification. Carbon monoxide was condensed at liquid nitrogen temperature; about one-quarter of the condensate was pumped off and discarded. Dry ice served as a convenient source of carbon dioxide. It was purified by subliming three-quarters of a sample into a liquid nitrogen cooled trap. The first quarter of this trapped fraction was discarded and the middle half used for mixture preparation.

Recently we showed that boundary layer effects must be considered in analyzing data obtained behind incident shocks; the growing boundary layer causes increases in temperature, density, and residence time with increasing distance behind the shock. Conditions behind the shocks, in the region of the experimental measurements, were obtained from a computer program which integrated the equations of chemical change for a shocked gas accounting for the effects of boundary layer buildup. In general, the extent of chemical reaction was small, and changes in gas properties were brought about largely by the gas dynamics associated with boundary layer growth.

Exponential growth constants were obtained from plots of the logarithm of observed light intensity against gas time; the relation between gas and laboratory times was obtained from the computer calculations.

Here  $ v_1 = k_1[H_2], v_2 = k_2[O_2], v_3 = k_3[H_2], v_4 = k_4[O_2][M] $, and  $ v_5 = k_5[CO] $. Thus the exponential growth constant  $ \lambda $ depends on the gas composition and the rate constants of reactions I to V.

## SELECTION OF GAS MIXTURES

Let us turn now to the rationale used to select gas mixtures by analysis of

equation (1). To begin with, under our experimental conditions  $ \nu_{4} $ is generally small in comparison with the other  $ \nu $'s and can be neglected for purposes of a qualitative discussion. Secondly,  $ \lambda $ turns out to be a small positive root - of the order of the smaller  $ \nu $ values and small compared with the larger  $ \nu $ values. Thus, we neglect  $ \lambda^{3} $ in comparison with the other terms and rewrite equation (1):

 $$ \left[(\nu_{1}+\nu_{5})+\nu_{2}+\nu_{3}\right]\lambda^{2}+\nu_{3}(\nu_{1}+\nu_{5})\lambda\equiv2\nu_{2}\nu_{3}(\nu_{1}+\nu_{5}) $$ 

If the amount of hydrogen in a mixture is large in comparison to oxygen,  $ \nu_1 $ and  $ \nu_3 $ are large and the term involving  $ \lambda^2 $ may be neglected; in this event,

 $$ \lambda\approx2\nu_{2} $$ 

On the other hand, if only a trace of hydrogen is present,  $ \nu_{3} $ is small, the term involving  $ \lambda $ may be neglected, and

 $$ \lambda^{2}\simeq\frac{2\nu_{2}\nu_{3}(\nu_{1}+\nu_{5})}{\nu_{2}+(\nu_{1}+\nu_{5})} $$ 

If we choose a mixture with a large amount of carbon monoxide,  $ \nu_{5} $ is large and

 $$ \lambda\sim\sqrt{2\nu_{2}\nu_{3}} $$ 

Whereas if there is a large amount of oxygen,  $ \nu_{2} $ is large and

 $$ \begin{aligned}&\lambda\sim\sqrt{2\nu_{3}(\nu_{1}+\nu_{5})}\\ &\begin{cases}\\ &{\rightarrow\sqrt{2\nu_{3}\nu_{1}}\quad&[\mathrm{H}_{2}]>[\mathrm{CO}]\\&{\rightarrow\sqrt{2\nu_{3}\nu_{5}}\quad&[\mathrm{CO}]>[\mathrm{H}_{2}]\\ &\end{cases}\\ \end{aligned} $$ 

This, then, outlines a strategy for obtaining rates of reactions I, II, III, and V. First, a mixture rich in hydrogen is used to determine  $ k_{2} $. Next, with  $ k_{2} $ known, a mixture with a trace of hydrogen and rich in carbon monoxide is used to determine  $ k_{3} $. Finally, with  $ k_{3} $ known, mixtures with excess oxygen and varying pro-

equation (1). To begin with, under our experimental conditions  $ v_{4} $ is generally small in comparison with the other  $ v_{8} $ and can be neglected for purposes of a qualitative discussion. Secondly,  $ \lambda $ turns out to be a small positive root - of the order of the smaller  $ v $ values and small compared with the larger  $ v $ values. Thus, we neglect  $ \lambda^{2} $ in comparison with the other terms and rewrite equation (1):

##  $ \left[(v_1 + v_2) + v_2 + v_3\right]\lambda^2 + v_3(v_1 + v_5)\lambda \approx 2v_2v_3(v_1 + v_5) $

If the amount of hydrogen in a mixture is large in comparison to oxygen,  $ O_{2} $ and  $ O_{2} $ are large and the term involving  $ A^{2} $ may be neglected; in this event,

On the other hand, if only a trace of hydrogen is present,  $ a_{2} $ is small, the term involving  $ \lambda $ may be neglected, and

 $ \lambda^2 = \frac{2v_2v_3(v_1 + v_3)}{v_2 + (v_1 + v_3)} $

If we choose a mixture with a large amount of carbon monoxide, as is large and

 $$ \lambda\sim\sqrt{2\nu_{2}\nu_{3}} $$ 

Whereas if there is a large amount of oxygen,  $ a_{2} $ is large and

 $ \lambda \sim \sqrt{2\nu_2(v_1 + v_5)} $

 $ \left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right] > \left[\mathrm{CO}\right] $

 $$ \left|CO\right|>\left|H_{2}\right| $$ 

This, then, outlines a strategy for obtaining rates of reactions I, II, III, and V. First, a mixture rich in hydrogen is used to determine k2. Next, with k2 known, a mixture with a trace of hydrogen and rich in carbon monoxide is used to determine k3. Finally, with k3 known, mixtures with excess oxygen and varying pro
