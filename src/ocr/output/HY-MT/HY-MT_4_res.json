For even lower bit-widths, the Weight-Int4 quantization strategy can further compress the 1.8B model to occupy less memory, catering to more demanding edge device constraints—though this comes at the cost of significant accuracy degradation. After comparing various quantization algorithms, we selected GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2023b) as the post-training quantization (PTQ) calibration strategy to minimize quantization error. This algorithm processes model weights layer by layer, leveraging a small amount of calibration data to minimize the reconstruction error of quantized weights, adjusting weights via an optimization process that approximates the inverse Hessian matrix. The workflow does not require model retraining; only a small calibration dataset is needed to quantize the weights, thereby improving inference efficiency and lowering the barrier to deployment.",

While ultra-low-bit quantization can compress models to an extreme degree, it also leads to substantial performance degradation. To mitigate this accuracy loss, we employ quantization-aware training (QAT) to reduce precision-related degradation through training. Unlike traditional QAT approaches, and considering the distribution characteristics of smaller models, we introduce an offset to better align the distribution of quantized weights with the original pre-quantization distribution. For 2-bit quantization, we apply symmetric quantization with a bias to achieve better results, while adopting per-channel granularity to ensure both inference performance and quantization accuracy. The weights for the model HY-MT1.5-1.8B-2BIT will be released in the near future.",
